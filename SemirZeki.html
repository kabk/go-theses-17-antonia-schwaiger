Semir Zeki

„all visual art is expressed through the brain and must therefore obey the laws of the brain
whether in conception, execution or appreciation and no theory of aesthetics that is not substantially based on the activity of the brain is ever likely to be complete, let alone profound.“

 Semir Zeki, Inner Visions: An Exploration of Art and the Brain,  (New York: Oxford University
Press, 1999).

Across disciplines Zekis statement that art must obey the laws of the brain read as a statement of authority over art analysis from the privileged position of a neuroscientist. Taken in context these statement seemed to function more as a justification to conduct speculative research with in the field of neuroscience rather then an empirical assault on other disciplines 


In inner visions Zeki communicated that he was not trying to address the art experience comprehensively, and that he could not address emotions through the lens of neuroscience in art and also that he was trying to propose a formula for art but that it was his own curiosity that motivated him to explore the connections between art and the brain.

At the same time, Zekis quote can be read, as an interdisciplinary provocation, suggesting that art follows the laws which are purview of neuroscience while at the same time dismissing the centuries long history of aethetics in the humanities.

his Statement function as a protest call for those who were arguing for and against the value of neuroaesthetics and created a considerable amount of negative response.

„ its people not their brains, that make and enjoy art“  Alva Noe 

 Alva Noë, “Art and the Limits of Neuroscience,” New York Times: The Opinion Pages ,
(December 4, 2011), http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/author/alva-noe
(accessed June 29, 2012).

Neuroscientist remain unable to to explain how consciousness is produced by the brain, and their neuroaestheticinvestigation allow a form of speculation and exploration which challenges the mythological and epistemological boundaries of their discipline.the neural processes that are most easily observed and measured by neuroscience are noncouncsious and they have traditionally bee associated with inherited and supposedly immutable neural strucktured.


Zeki’s research has always been based to the bottom-up model of consciousness, which is a traditional neuroscientific  paradigm in which it is assumed that small components of  brain anatomy - localized networks of neurons assigned with particular tasks-transfer signals upwards through the complex system, from the non conscious zones low in the network towards the higher cognitive areas where the conscious thought occurs.

bottom- up model of vision meaning that non conscious processes are understood to form the foundation of conscious processing, and thereby driving the entire system.
zech has emphasized the active character of vision as meaningful process of engaging with the world. he described the brain as actively seeking stimuli and making contingent decisions, even at non conscious levels.  

which means however that he assumed the stance of privileging  non conscious processes at first and therefor causal,
events determanating human perception. he turned to art analysis, as a means of querying the extensive neuroscience of vision, a collective body of knowledge to which he has made significant contributions.

one example would be his speculative theory of micro-consciousness. which describes that certain perceptions such as color, do not require involvement from higher brain areas, such as the cerebral cortex, in order to become conscious. he suggested that certain points in the synaptic chains operate as „essential nodes“,site where the sensory information becomes a perception, giving rise to local microconsciounesses.
Zeki, Splendours and Miseries of the Brain ,  

In his research on human color perception he demonstrated that color itself is a construct of contingent and rational neural processes. he constructed the laws of of the brain as active processes of engagement, conveying impressions of the brains as a living organism formed through ongoing interactions with the environment with the environment.

He dresses that art is an active process and he insists that the artist and the brain share a common goal; to gather knowledge about the world.
