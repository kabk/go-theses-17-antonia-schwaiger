		  <h1>NEUROAesthetics</h1>

			<h2>„All visual art is expressed through the brain and must 
			therefore obey the laws of the brain
			whether in conception, execution or appreciation and no 
			theory of aesthetics that is not substantially based on the
			 activity of the brain is ever likely to be complete, 
			let alone profound.“ </h2>

			<p> Across disciplines Zekis statement that art must obey the laws of the brain read as a statement of authority over art analysis from the privileged position of a neuroscientist. Taken in context these statement seemed to function more as a justification to conduct speculative research with in the field of neuroscience rather then an empirical assault on other disciplines. 
			In his book Inner Visions Zeki communicated that he was not trying to address the art experience comprehensively, and that he could not address emotions through the lens of neuroscience in art and also that he was trying to propose a formula for art but that it was his own curiosity that motivated him to explore the connections between art and the brain.
			At the same time, Zekis quote can be read, as an interdisciplinary provocation, suggesting that art follows the laws which are purview of neuroscience while at the same time dismissing the centuries long history of aethetics in the humanities.
			His Statement function as a protest call for those who were arguing for and against the value of neuroaesthetics and created a considerable amount of negative response.

			<h2>„its people not their brains, 
			that make and enjoy art“  
			Alva Noe </h2>
			<p>
			Neuroscientist remain unable to to explain how consciousness is produced by the brain, and their neuroaesthetic investigation allow a form of speculation and exploration which challenges the mythological and epistemological boundaries of their discipline. The neural processes that are most easily observed and measured by neuroscience are noncouncsious and they have traditionally bee associated with inherited and supposedly immutable neural strucktured.

			Zeki’s research has always been based to the bottom-up model of consciousness, which is a traditional neuroscientific  paradigm in which it is assumed that small components of  brain anatomy - localized networks of neurons assigned with particular tasks-transfer signals upwards through the complex system, from the non conscious zones low in the network towards the higher cognitive areas where the conscious thought occurs.
			</p>

			<h2>bottom- up model of vision</h2>
			<p>meaning that non conscious processes are the base to form the foundation of conscious processing, and thereby driving the entire system.
			Zeki has emphasized the active character of vision as meaningful process of engaging with the world. He described the brain as actively seeking stimuli and making contingent decisions, even at non conscious levels.  
			Which leads to the conclusion that he assumed the stance of privileging  non conscious processes at first and therefor causal, events determanating human perception. 

			He turned to art analysis, as a means of querying the extensive neuroscience of vision, a collective body of knowledge to which he has made significant contributions.

			One example would be his speculative theory of micro-consciousness. In which Zeki describes that certain perceptions such as color, do not require involvement from higher brain areas, such as the cerebral cortex, in order to become conscious. He suggested that certain points in the synaptic chains operate as „essential nodes“, site where the sensory information becomes a perception, giving rise to local microconsciounesses.

			<p>In recent writings on the differences between pixel, rem, and em units, the general principle on em units that has emerged is that they should be used for properties that should scale along with the elements font size. The letter spacing on the text elements in this pen are defined in ems, such that as the sizing changes the spacing between letters changes proportionally as well.</p>
